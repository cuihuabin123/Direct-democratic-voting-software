#民主投票软件
本软件的目的是实现人人都可以参与、直接参与讨论政治活动的新型直接民主制度。本软件的目的是实现人人都可以参与、直接参与政治问题讨论的新型直接民主制度中。
声明文件

这是一个尝试对现有民主制度进行创新的软件。
本软件试图实现以下目的：
所有人可以直接参与政治议题的讨论，无需授权他人，不需要被代表。
现在所有国家的民主制度都是代议制民主，也就是大部分人将权利授予少数人，然后由少数人代表自己进行政治议题的讨论。而本软件试图尝试让所有人直接参与政治议题讨论，而不是授权他人。
本软件现在只是第一版，可行性测试版本，功能非常有限。仅仅实现了以下功能：
1，所有用户都有权利发起投票，也就是所有用户有权提出自己的议案。
2，所有用户都有一票否决权，也就是只要一个用户对其他用户的投票进行否决，其他用户发起的议案投票就要被中止。
3，如果被否决的用户对其他用户的否决意见有异议，可以提起管理员裁决。

本软件现在的功能非常简单，非常粗陋，那是因为这仅仅是一个可行性测试版本，仅仅为了测试直接民主制度在软件设计层面是否可行。

因为详细的文章太长，不适合放在这里，所以这里仅仅对直接民主设计进行简单论述，想要看详细论述的可以自己点击链接去看。
这个软件设计的思想是这样的。
我们在长期的实践中已经发现，代议制民主存在严重漏洞，那些被授权的人，往往并不真的关心那些授权人需要什么，提出的议案并不代表授权民众的真实想法，切实利益。所以我们需要人们直接参与政治议题，直接提出自己真实的需求，来更好的管理社会，更好的保护每个人的利益。
另外，从技术角度来说，在以前，实际上不具备实现直接民主的条件，因为在互联网时代之前，信息流通的成本是非常高的，实行直接民主是不现实的。而现在这个互联网时代，信息流通的成本极低，大部分人都可以非常方便的在网上进行政治讨论，实行直接民主制度不会显著增加政治管理的成本。
现在我们有了技术了，有了需求，那么如何实现呢，经过我个人的构思，我认为首先需要授权每个人都有平等的权利去提出自己的看法，体检在软件上就是每个用户都有权写出自己的议案，发起投票。
然后我们还需要平等的权利去否决其他人提出的不合理方案，也就是赋予每个用户一票否决权。目前我的设计是一票否决的原因有三个：1，要求特殊权利，2，违背科学原理，3，不可执行。
这样乍一看，似乎只能让所有用户炒成一团，什么都做不了，实际上我想要的是，所有人
在互相否决和讨论中逐渐达成一致，最终得出一个所有人都不反对的议案，而这个议案才是真正的代表所有人利益，同时切实可行的方案。
在这个投票，否决的过程中，因为所有人都有权提起议案，所有人都有一票否决权，那么那些要求特殊权利的议案，不公平的议案，不可行的议案都会被否决掉，因为只要一个人不同意，就无法通过，随意最终通过的议案，一定是公平，合理，可行，兼顾所有人利益的议案。
这样的制度和结果，既能避免多数人的暴政，也能避免少数人的独裁。
最后这里还要提一句，这个直接民主制度，是我为了共产主义社会而设计的政治制度，它的最佳匹配经济制度是公有制和按需分配。
直接民主制度在当下这个经济制度环境下，其实不能完美运行，这是因为现行制度下人与人之间存在不可调和的利益冲突，很多时候保护某些人的利益，就要牺牲其他人的利益。

最后的最后，再次提醒本软件现在的版本仅仅是可行性验证版本，相比于理想中的最终设计版本，是及其不完善的，只不过我没钱也没有能力继续进行下一步的工作了。我本人不是软件相关行业人员，这个软件是我花钱请人帮我做出来的，因为下一步的继续开发工作需要很多人进行大量的开发工作，而我没钱也没有能力，所以将软件放在这里，希望有其他有能力或者有钱的人能够继续完成下一步的开发工作。

This is a software that attempts to innovate the existing democratic system.
This software attempts to achieve the following objectives:
Everyone can directly participate in the discussion of political issues without authorizing others or being represented.
Nowadays, the democratic system in all countries is representative democracy, which means that the majority delegates power to a minority, and then the minority represents themselves in discussing political issues. And this software attempts to allow everyone to directly participate in political discussions, rather than authorizing others.
This software is currently only the first version, a feasibility test version, with very limited functionality. Only the following functions have been implemented:
1. All users have the right to initiate voting, which means that all users have the right to propose their own proposals.
2. All users have one veto power, which means that if one user vetoes the votes of other users, the voting on proposals initiated by other users will be suspended.
3. If the rejected user has objections to the rejection opinions of other users, they can file an administrator ruling.
The current functionality of this software is very simple and crude, because it is only a feasibility test version, just to test whether the direct democratic system is feasible at the software design level.
The following link is my personal conception and imagination of the future society, based on a direct democratic system.
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/576982098
The following link is a theoretical derivation about direct democracy, which is why it is necessary to achieve direct democracy in the future.

If you are also interested in my other ideas, you can click on the link to watch other articles I have written.

Because the detailed article is too long to be placed here, only a brief discussion on direct democratic design will be provided here. If you want to see a detailed discussion, you can click on the link to read it yourself.
The design philosophy of this software is as follows.
We have found in long-term practice that representative democracy has serious loopholes. Those who are authorized often do not really care about what those authorizing people need, and the proposals put forward do not represent the true thoughts and interests of the authorized people. So we need people to directly participate in political issues, express their real needs, in order to better manage society and protect everyone's interests.
In addition, from the technical point of view, in the past, there was no condition for realizing direct democracy, because before the Internet era, the cost of information circulation was very high, and it was unrealistic to implement direct democracy. In the Internet era, the cost of information circulation is extremely low. Most people can easily have political discussions online. The implementation of direct democracy will not significantly increase the cost of political management.
Now that we have the technology and the requirements, how can we implement it? Based on my personal ideas, I believe that the first step is to authorize everyone to have equal rights to express their opinions. Physical examination in software means that every user has the right to write their own proposal and initiate voting.
Then we also need equal rights to veto unreasonable proposals put forward by others, that is, to give each user one veto power. At present, there are three reasons why my design is vetoed with one vote: 1. Request for special rights, 2. Violation of scientific principles, and 3. Inability to execute.
At first glance, it may seem like all users can only be hyped up and nothing can be done. In fact, what I want is for everyone
Gradually reaching a consensus through mutual veto and discussion, and ultimately arriving at a proposal that no one opposes, which is the true representative of everyone's interests and a practical and feasible solution.
In this voting and veto process, because everyone has the right to propose a proposal and has one veto power, any proposal that demands special rights, is unfair, or is not feasible will be rejected because as long as one person disagrees, it cannot be passed. A proposal that is ultimately passed arbitrarily must be fair, reasonable, feasible, and take into account the interests of all parties.
This system and outcome can avoid both the tyranny of the majority and the dictatorship of the minority.
Finally, I would like to mention that this direct democratic system is a political system designed by me for a communist society, and its best match for the economic system is public ownership and distribution according to demand.
Finally, I would like to remind you that the current version of this software is only a feasibility verification version, which is extremely incomplete compared to the ideal final design version. However, I do not have the money or ability to continue with the next step of work. I am not a professional in the software industry. I paid someone to help me create this software because the next step of development requires a lot of people to do a lot of work, and I don't have the money or ability. Therefore, I have put the software here, hoping that other capable or wealthy people can continue to complete the next step of development work.
